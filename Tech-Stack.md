The Supercharging Portal for Landlords has been built using the MERN stack, which is a popular combination of technologies for developing full-stack web applications. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Here's a brief overview of each component of the MERN stack:

* MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL document-based database that allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of data in JSON-like documents. MongoDB is highly scalable and flexible, making it an ideal choice for web applications that require dynamic data storage and retrieval.

* Express.js: Express.js is a powerful and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of robust features for building web applications and APIs, including middleware support, routing, templating, and much more.

* React.js: React.js is a popular front-end library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides a declarative syntax for building complex UIs.

* Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows for the execution of JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a powerful set of tools and libraries for building scalable and performant web applications.

Together, the MERN stack provides a powerful and flexible set of tools for building full-stack web applications. The use of MongoDB allows for efficient data storage and retrieval, while Express.js and Node.js provide a powerful server-side framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests. Finally, React.js provides a flexible and powerful client-side library for building dynamic user interfaces.
